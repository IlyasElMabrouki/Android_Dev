# Race Tracker App
The Race Tracker App is a simple Android application designed to simulate a race between two players. The app showcases the usage of Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous operations and integrates Material Theming principles for a modern and visually appealing user interface.

## Project Description

The Race Tracker App allows users to simulate the progress of two players in a race. Key features of the app include:

- **Simulated Race**: The app simulates the progress of two players in a race, displaying their current position and progress in real-time.
- **Control Options**: Users can control the race simulation by starting, pausing, or resetting the race using intuitive buttons in the user interface.
- **Visual Feedback**: The app provides visual feedback to users through progress bars and dynamic updates, enhancing the user experience and engagement.
- **Runner Simulation**: The progress of each runner is represented by an icon moving along the race track, providing a visual representation of their movement.

## Usage of Coroutines for Managing Runners' Progress

The Race Tracker App utilizes Kotlin coroutines for managing asynchronous operations, such as updating the progress of the runners in the race. Here's how coroutines are used in the project:

- **Concurrency**: Coroutines enable concurrent execution of tasks, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions while performing background operations.
- **Progress Simulation**: Each runner's progress is simulated using a coroutine, allowing for efficient and non-blocking updates to the UI as the race progresses.
- **Cancellation and Pausing**: Coroutines facilitate easy cancellation and pausing of tasks, allowing the race simulation to be paused or reset without unnecessary resource consumption.

## Integration of Material Theming

The Race Tracker App integrates Material Theming principles to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. Here's how Material Theming is integrated into the project:

- **Material Design Components**: The app utilizes a variety of Material Design components provided by Jetpack Compose, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Custom Theming**: The app defines its own custom theme, specifying colors, typography, and other visual attributes to create a unique and branded user interface.

By leveraging Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous operations and integrating Material Theming principles, the Race Tracker App delivers a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing user experience while simulating the progress of the race between two players.
